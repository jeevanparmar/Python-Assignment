    "16. What are the advantages of OOP?**  \n",
    "- OOP provides better code organization through encapsulation and modularity. It promotes reusability via inheritance and flexibility using polymorphism. Abstraction helps in hiding complexity, making programs easier to manage. It also enables code maintenance and scalability in large software projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**  \n",
    "- Class variables are shared across all instances of a class and are defined at the class level. Instance variables are unique to each object and are defined within the constructor or methods using `self`. Changing a class variable affects all instances, whereas an instance variable change affects only that specific object.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?**  \n",
    "- Multiple inheritance occurs when a class derives from more than one base class. It allows a subclass to inherit features from multiple parent classes. Python handles method conflicts through a method resolution order (MRO) to determine which method to call if there's ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.**  \n",
    "- `__str__` provides a user-friendly string representation of an object, mainly used for display. `__repr__` is intended for developers and should return a string that can recreate the object if possible. If `__str__` is not defined, `__repr__` is used as a fallback.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?**  \n",
    "- The `super()` function is used to call methods from a parent class, enabling access to inherited behavior. It is especially helpful in method overriding and in multiple inheritance where it ensures the proper method resolution. It also reduces hardcoding of class names, improving maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**  \n",
    "- The `__del__` method is a destructor that is automatically invoked when an object is about to be destroyed. It is mainly used to release external resources such as file handles or network connections. However, its usage should be limited due to unpredictable garbage collection timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?**  \n",
    "- A `@staticmethod` doesn’t take any implicit first argument and cannot modify class or instance state. A `@classmethod` takes `cls` as the first argument and can access or modify class-level attributes. Both are used when method logic doesn't require access to instance attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**  \n",
    "- In inheritance, polymorphism allows different classes to implement the same method in their own way. It enables the use of a unified interface for different data types or objects. Python dynamically resolves which method to call based on the object’s actual class at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?**  \n",
    "- Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called in a single line using the same object. Each method returns the object itself (`self`) to allow further calls. It improves code readability and is commonly used in fluent interfaces or builders.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?**  \n",
    "- The `__call__` method allows an object to be invoked like a regular function. This makes the object behave like a callable and is useful in scenarios like decorators, wrappers, or callable classes. It enhances flexibility and reusability in object design."
